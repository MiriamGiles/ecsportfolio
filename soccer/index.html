	  <h3>My Soccer Life</h3>
	  <p> I started soccer when I was 6 years old. Soccer has been a part of my family for a very long time. 
	All 3 of my brothers at one point of their lives played soccer. 2 of my brothers have played soccer for as long as I can remember. 
	My family almost never had a saturday where there were no games.</p>

	  <h3>Spotlight: My Brother</h3>
	  <p> My brother has always inspired me to play since I was a kid. During his time playing soccer at Skyline, he broke his 
		  collar-bone four times. The fourth time he broke it was right in the middle of his senior year. He was very frustrated. 
		  That year they lost in State Finals. He was very sad to not have been able to play in the finals his senior year. But,
		  he kept his head up through it all. He continued to stay positive during this hard time. He devoted his life to soccer. 
		  Even with him not being able to play his senior year, he still was just a positive and happy friend and brother. 
		  He will always be an inspiration to me. </p>
