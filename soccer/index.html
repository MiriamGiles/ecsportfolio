	  <h3>Part of my life</h3>
	  <p> I started soccer when I was 6 years old. Soccer has been a part of my family for a very long time. 
	All 3 of my brothers at one point of their lives played soccer. 2 of my brothers have played soccer for as long as I can remember. 
	My family almost never had a saturday where there were no games.</p>
